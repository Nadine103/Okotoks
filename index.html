<h4>The different names from different country</h4>
Manilkara zapota, commonly known as sapodilla (sapo), sapota, chikoo, chico, naseberry,
or nispero[1] is a long-lived, evergreen tree native to southern Mexico, Central America 
and the Caribbean.[2] An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucatán in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion,
where it is a subdominant plant species.[3] It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization.
It is grown in large quantities in India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam,
Bangladesh and Mexico. The name "zapota" from the Spanish zapote [saˈpote] ultimately derives from the Nahuatl
word tzapotl. Sapodilla is known as mispel in the Virgin Islands[1] and Dutch Caribbean; zapote in Honduras and Panama;
níspero in Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guyana, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela; 
dilly in the Bahamas; naseberry in Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean; sapoti in Brazil (Portuguese pronunciation: 
[sɐpuˈtʃi]) and Haiti; chico in the Philippines and chicosapote or chicozapote in Guatemala, Mexico, Hawaii, and Florida.
In Pakistan & Northern India, the fruit is known as chikoo. In Eastern India, it is called sapeta or sabeda. 
In Southern India, it is called as chikoo as well and its most popular variety is commonly called as pala sapota. 
In Sri Lanka, the fruit is known as sepadilla.

        <h3>Biological studies of the furit</h3>
        Compounds extracted from the leaves showed anti-diabetic, antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic (cholesterol-lowering) effects in rats.
        Acetone extracts of the seeds exhibited in vitro antibacterial effects against strains of Pseudomonas oleovorans and Vibrio cholerae.[11]

        <h4>The discripton of Sapodilla (Naseberry) both tree and the furit itself</h4>
        Sapodilla can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) tall with an average trunk diameter of 1.5 m (5 ft). 
        The average height of cultivated specimens, however, is usually between 9 and 15 m (30 and 49 ft) 
        with a trunk diameter not exceeding 50 cm (20 in).[4] It is wind-resistant and the bark is rich in a white, 
        gummy latex called chicle. The ornamental leaves are medium green and glossy. They are alternate, 
        elliptic to ovate, 7–15 cm (3–6 in) long, with an entire margin. The white flowers are inconspicuous and 
        bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla. An unripe fruit has a firm outer skin and when picked, releases white 
        chicle from its stem. A fully ripened fruit has saggy skin and does not release chicle when picked.
        The fruit is a large berry, 4–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter.
        Inside, its flesh ranges from a pale yellow to an earthy brown color with a grainy texture 
        akin to that of a well-ripened pear. Each fruit contains one to six seeds.
        The seeds are hard, glossy, and black, resembling beans, with a hook at one end that can catch 
        in the throat if swallowed. The fruit has an exceptionally sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit is hard to the 
        touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar to tannin, drying out the 
        mouth. The trees can survive only in warm, typically tropical environments, dying easily if the temperature
        drops below freezing. From germination, the sapodilla tree will usually take anywhere from five to 
        eight years to bear fruit. The sapodilla trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round.
